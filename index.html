    <h1>Welcome to Your Extended Family</h1>

    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <p>
        Building your own village is necessary now mre than ever to build a supportive and thriving
        community from scratch. It gives you the opportunity to design and shape the environment according to your
        family's
        vision and needs. It's hard being alone but with your village there, virtually or in person, you're never alone.

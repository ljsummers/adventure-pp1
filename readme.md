# Drinks & Giggles

Drinks & Giggles is a new bar launghing in Cork city which is looking to gain a prominent position as the hottest bar to socialise, party and enjoy a hearty meal in. 

The best way to advertise the business and also inform new customers is to build a website which features:

- when the bar launches in Cork 
- what the UPI (unique selling point) of the bar is 
- what drinks and meals they offer
- where they are located 
- ways to connect with the bar via social media 


## Goals

**Client Goals**

- To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
- To make it easy for customers to find out about the bar/launch. 
- To make it easy for customers to send a message to the bar or book a table.

**First Time Visitor Goals**

- I want to be able to find out what Drinks & Giggles is. 
- I want to be able to navigate the site easily to find information on what they offer.
- I want to be able to contact them bar on social media/contact forms if I have questions. 
- I want to be able to book a table. 


## Design

**Color Scheme** 

The website uses a palette of [summery/bright/fun colours](https://coolors.co/068d9d-fc7753-f6f7f8-dea54b) that can be linked to cocktails. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website and was made with hero image in mind. 

**Typography** 

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

Ysabeau SC is used for body on the site. It is a Garamond font.

Dancing Script is used for the title/header text on the site. It is a cursive font.

**Imagery**

All imagery was used from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/drinks/). I have credited these in the credits section.

**Features**

The website is comprised of six pages, five of which are accessible from the navigation menu. 

To ensure consistency and a user friendly system: 

- All Pages on the website have a responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. 
- A footer which contains social media icon links to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.





**Home Page**

A quick description as to what the website is about with a hero image to instantly identify as to Drinks & Giggles is about. 



A message thanks the user for submitting the form and lets them know someone will be in touch soon.


**Future Implementations**

- Use javascript to perform form validation data on booking/contact form.
- Competitions/promotions page. 

**Accessibility**

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

- The pages were regularly tested in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, iPhone 12, iPhone 14 Pro Max and an iPad Air, both in vertical and horizontal mode.

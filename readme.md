The best way to advertise the business and also inform new customers is to build a website which features:

- when the bar launches in Cork. 
- what the UPI (unique selling point) of the bar is. 
- what drinks and meals they offer.
- where they are located. 
- ways to connect with the bar via social media. 


## User Experience

**User Stories**

- To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
- To make it easy for customers to find out about the bar/launch. 
- To make it easy for customers to send a message to the bar or book a table.

**First Time Visitor Goals**

- I want to be able to find out what Drinks & Giggles is. 
- I want to be able to navigate the site easily to find information on what they offer.
- I want to be able to contact them bar on social media/contact forms if I have questions. 
- I want to be able to book a table. 


## Design

**Color Scheme** 

The website uses a palette of [summery/bright/fun colours](https://coolors.co/068d9d-fc7753-f6f7f8-dea54b) that can be linked to cocktails. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website and was made with hero image in mind. 

**Typography** 

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

*Ysabeau SC is used for body on the site. It is a Garamond font.*

*Dancing Script is used for the title/header text on the site. It is a cursive font.*


**Imagery**

All imagery was used from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/drinks/). I have credited these in the credits section.

## Features

The website is comprised of six pages, five of which are accessible from the navigation menu. 

To ensure consistency and a user friendly system: 

- All Pages on the website have a responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. <br>

- A footerwhich contains social media icon links to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable. <br>

- The same color scheme is applied throughout the website to keep it on brand. 

**Home Page** <br>
A quick description as to what the website is about with a hero image to instantly identify as to Drinks & Giggles is about. It also advertises the opening night event. <br>

**About Page** <br>
A more comphregensive description as to the bar is, what it aims to bring to the public, sells the UPI about community and an experience to enjoy.  <br>

**Menu Page** <br>
Carrying on the theme of vibrant colors, the menu offers what cocktails are available as well as brunch/dinner options so the public can peruse in advance of visiting the bar. <br>

**Booking Page** <br>
Users can book a reservation for up to 8 people using the booking page. Without using Javascript, the form leads to an error page upon clicking 'book now'. <br>

The contact page provides opening times, the address as well as a general form for users to submit if they have any questions about the bar. There is also a map which gives a general direction to the bar's location. <br>

**Thank You Page** <br>
This page was created in mind for thanking the user for submitting the form (booking or contact) and lets them know someone will be in touch soon. <br>

**Future Implementations**

- Use javascript to perform form validation data on booking/contact form.
- Competitions/promotions page. 
- calendar validation to ensure the bar doesn't take too many bookings for the same day/time. 
- including gluten and allergy menus. 

**Accessibility**

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
- Checking the accessibility score on Lighthouse ([mobile](https://github.com/ljsummers/drinks-giggles/blob/35640d4d95b116e0c25b0f3a72851a0d47b1fb4c/assets/images/readme/lightspeed_mobile.png) and [desktop](https://github.com/ljsummers/drinks-giggles/blob/35640d4d95b116e0c25b0f3a72851a0d47b1fb4c/assets/images/readme/lightspeed_desktop.png)) and Wave.

## Testing & Bugs

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

- The pages were regularly tested in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, iPhone 12, iPhone 14 Pro Max and an iPad Air, both in vertical and horizontal mode.
- The site is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched. No elements overlap.
- I have tested that every single link on the site work as intended within current scripting limitations. 

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

- unable to link thankyou.html to the booking/contact page without JavaScript.
- bullet points on the index page looked out of place. 
- aboutus page needed to have margins added to make readability easier.
- unable to use favicons to create TikTok links.
